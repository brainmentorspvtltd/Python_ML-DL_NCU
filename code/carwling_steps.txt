1. Import bs4 and urllib.request
2. open url using urllib.request
3. Make Object of BeautifulSoup
4. Find out tag and class on that tag from where we have to fetch data
5. Use tags = bs.find_all('tagName', class_='className')
6. Now you'll get a list of tags based on that class.
7. Using a for loop extract text from tags
	- for data in tags:
		print(data.text)
